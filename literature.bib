	abstract = "Real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) is a standard technique in most laboratories used for various applications in basic research. Analysis of qPCR data is a crucial part of the entire experiment, which has led to the development of a plethora of methods. The released tools either cover specific parts of the workflow or provide complete analysis solutions. Here, we surveyed 27 open-access software packages and tools for the analysis of qPCR data. The survey includes 8 Microsoft Windows, 5 web-based, 9 R-based and 5 tools from other platforms. Reviewed packages and tools support the analysis of different qPCR applications, such as RNA quantification, DNA methylation, genotyping, identification of copy number variations, and digital PCR. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual software tools, such as data exchange formats, availability of a graphical user interface, included procedures for graphical data presentation, and offered statistical methods. In addition, we provide an overview about quantification strategies, and report various applications of qPCR. Our comprehensive survey showed that most tools use their own file format and only a fraction of the currently existing tools support the standardized data exchange format RDML. To allow a more streamlined and comparable analysis of qPCR data, more vendors and tools need to adapt the standardized format to encourage the exchange of data between instrument software, analysis tools, and researchers.",

The current status of R is a command line driven interface with no advanced cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI), but it includes tools for building such.

For example, Rgui.exe and Rgui.app have become the de facto GUI on the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms, respectively, for most users. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a comprehensive GUI and an integrated development environment for R. RKWard is based on the KDE software libraries. Statistical procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin architecture based on ECMAScript (JavaScript), R, and XML. RKWard provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects; even allowing for seamless editing of certain types.

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: Quantification cycle (Cq) and amplification efficiency (AE) are parameters mathematically extracted from raw data to characterize quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions and quantify the copy number in a sample. Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data. METHODS: We obtained published high-replicate qPCR data sets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and AE. RESULTS: Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and AE considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all qPCR scenarios. The Savitzky--Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in qPCR AE, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an AE-dependent bias. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time PCR experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic qPCR applications. The findings of our study were implemented in the R packages chipPCR and qpcR as a basis for the implementation of an analytical strategy.",

	abstract = "Despite the central role of quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the quantification of mRNA transcripts, most analyses of qPCR data are still delegated to the software that comes with the qPCR apparatus. This is especially true for the handling of the fluorescence baseline. This article shows that baseline estimation errors are directly reflected in the observed PCR efficiency values and are thus propagated exponentially in the estimated starting concentrations as well as 'fold-difference' results. Because of the unknown origin and kinetics of the baseline fluorescence, the fluorescence values monitored in the initial cycles of the PCR reaction cannot be used to estimate a useful baseline value. An algorithm that estimates the baseline by reconstructing the log-linear phase downward from the early plateau phase of the PCR reaction was developed and shown to lead to very reproducible PCR efficiency values. PCR efficiency values were determined per sample by fitting a regression line to a subset of data points in the log-linear phase. The variability, as well as the bias, in qPCR results was significantly reduced when the mean of these PCR efficiencies per amplicon was used in the calculation of an estimate of the starting concentration per sample.",

With the increased use of RDML new challenges emerge. The flexibility of the RDML format resulted in some implementations that did not meet the expectations of the consortium in the level of support or the use of elements.ResultsIn the current RDML version 1.2 the description of the elements was sharpened. The open source editor RDML-Ninja was released (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpcr-ninja/). RDML-Ninja allows to visualize, edit and validate RDML files and thus clarifies the use of RDML elements. Furthermore RDML-Ninja serves as reference implementation for RDML and enables migration between RDML versions independent of the instrument software. The database RDMLdb will serve as an online repository for RDML files and facilitate the exchange of RDML data (http://www.rdmldb.org). Authors can upload their RDML files and reference them in publications by the unique identifier provided by RDMLdb. The MIQE guidelines propose a rich set of information required to document each qPCR run. RDML provides the vehicle to store and maintain this information and current development aims at further integration of MIQE requirements into the RDML format.ConclusionsThe editor RDML-Ninja and the database RDMLdb enable scientists to evaluate and exchange qPCR data in the instrument-independent RDML format. We are confident that this infrastructure will build the foundation for standardized qPCR data exchange among scientists, research groups, and during publication.",

@article{ruijter_removal_2015,
	abstract = "Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the method of choice in gene expression analysis. However, the number of groups or treatments, target genes and technical replicates quickly exceeds the capacity of a single run on a qPCR machine and the measurements have to be spread over more than 1 plate. Such multi-plate measurements often show similar proportional differences between experimental conditions, but different absolute values, even though the measurements were technically carried out with identical procedures. Removal of this between-plate variation will enhance the power of the statistical analysis on the resulting data. Inclusion and application of calibrator samples, with replicate measurements distributed over the plates, assumes a multiplicative difference between plates. However, random and technical errors in these calibrators will propagate to all samples on the plate. To avoid this effect, the systematic bias between plates can be removed with a correction factor based on all overlapping technical and biological replicates between plates. This approach removes the requirement for all calibrator samples to be measured successfully on every plate. This paper extends an already published factor correction method to the use in multi-plate qPCR experiments. The between-run correction factor is derived from the target quantities which are calculated from the quantification threshold, PCR efficiency and observed Cq value. To enable further statistical analysis in existing qPCR software packages, an efficiency-corrected Cq value is reported, based on the corrected target quantity and a PCR efficiency per target. The latter is calculated as the mean of the PCR efficiencies taking the number of reactions per amplicon per plate into account. Export to the RDML format completes an RDML-supported analysis pipeline of qPCR data ranging from raw fluorescence data, amplification curve analysis and application of reference genes to statistical analysis.",

	abstract = "Since numerous miRNAs have been shown to be present in circulation, these so-called circulating miRNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers for disease. However, results of qPCR studies on circulating miRNA biomarkers vary greatly and many experiments cannot be reproduced. Missing data in qPCR experiments often occur due to off-target amplification, nonanalyzable qPCR curves and discordance between replicates. The low concentration of most miRNAs leads to most, but not all missing data. Therefore, failure to distinguish between missing data due to a low concentration and missing data due to randomly occurring technical errors partly explains the variation within and between otherwise similar studies. Based on qPCR kinetics, an analysis pipeline was developed to distinguish missing data due to technical errors from missing data due to a low concentration of the miRNA-equivalent cDNA in the PCR reaction. Furthermore, this pipeline incorporates a method to statistically decide whether concentrations from replicates are sufficiently concordant, which improves stability of results and avoids unnecessary data loss. By going through the pipeline's steps, the result of each measurement is categorized as ``valid, invalid, or undetectable.'' Together with a set of imputation rules, the pipeline leads to more robust and reproducible data as was confirmed experimentally. Using two validation approaches, in two cohorts totaling 2214 heart failure patients, we showed that this pipeline increases both the accuracy and precision of qPCR measurements. In conclusion, this statistical data handling pipeline improves the performance of qPCR studies on low-expressed targets such as circulating miRNAs.",

The real-time PCR data markup language (RDML) is a recommended standard of the minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines. Despite the popularity of the RDML format for analysis of quantitative PCR data, handling of RDML files is not yet widely supported in all PCR curve analysis softwares.Results: This study describes the open-source RDML package for the statistical computing language R. RDML is compatible with RDML versions ≤ 1.2 and provides functionality to (i) import RDML data; (ii) extract sample information (e.g. targets and concentration); (iii) transform data to various formats of the R environment; (iv) generate human-readable run summaries; and (v) to create RDML files from user data. In addition, RDML offers a graphical user interface to read, edit and create RDML files.Availability and implementation:https://cran.r-project.org/package=RDML. rdmlEdit server http://shtest.evrogen.net/rdmlEdit/.

Given this, the ability to amplify total DNA obtained from evidence, in an unbiased manner, would be highly advantageous. Methods for whole genome amplification (WGA) have the potential to fulfill this role, resulting in a virtually unlimited supply of DNA. In the research presented, two WGA methods, improved primer extension preamplification and multiple displacement amplification (MDA), were tested using commercial kits. Control DNA, artificially degraded DNA, and DNA from fresh blood, aged blood, hair shafts, and aged bones underwent WGA, followed by short tandem repeat and mitochondrial DNA analysis. The methods did amplify DNA, but performed poorly on forensically relevant samples; the maximum amplicon size was reduced, and MDA often resulted in extraneous bands following polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, WGA appears to be of limited forensic utility unless the samples are of a very high quality.",

However, little information is available how to statistically compare dPCR runs of multiple runs or reduplicates. The comparison of λ values from several runs is a multiple comparison problem, which can be solved using the binary structure of dPCR data. We propose and evaluate two novel methods based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multiple Ratio Tests (MRT) for comparison of digital PCR experiments. We enriched our MRT framework with computation of simultaneous confidence intervals suitable for comparing multiple dPCR runs. The evaluation of both statistical methods support that MRT is faster and more robust for dPCR experiments performed in large scale. Our theoretical results were confirmed by the analysis of dPCR measurements of dilution series. Both methods were implemented in the dpcR package (v. 0.2) for the open source R statistical computing environment.",

@article{feuer_lemming:_2015,
	abstract = "Background Gene expression analysis is an essential part of biological and medical investigations. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is characterized with excellent sensitivity, dynamic range, reproducibility and is still regarded to be the gold standard for quantifying transcripts abundance. Parallelization of qPCR such as by microfluidic Taqman Fluidigm Biomark Platform enables evaluation of multiple transcripts in samples treated under various conditions. Despite advanced technologies, correct evaluation of the measurements remains challenging. Most widely used methods for evaluating or calculating gene expression data include geNorm and ΔΔ C t , respectively. They rely on one or several stable reference genes (RGs) for normalization, thus potentially causing biased results. We therefore applied multivariable regression with a tailored error model to overcome the necessity of stable RGs. Results We developed a RG independent data normalization approach based on a tailored l inear e rror m odel for parallel qPCR data, called LEMming. It uses the assumption that the mean C t values within samples of similarly treated groups are equal. Performance of LEMming was evaluated in three data sets with different stability patterns of RGs and compared to the results of geNorm normalization. Data set 1 showed that both methods gave similar results if stable RGs are available. Data set 2 included RGs which are stable according to geNorm criteria, but became differentially expressed in normalized data evaluated by a t-test. geNorm -normalized data showed an effect of a shifted mean per gene per condition whereas LEMming-normalized data did not. Comparing the decrease of standard deviation from raw data to geNorm and to LEMming, the latter was superior. In data set 3 according to geNorm calculated average expression stability and pairwise variation, stable RGs were available, but t-tests of raw data contradicted this. Normalization with RGs resulted in distorted data contradicting literature, while LEMming normalized data did not. Conclusions If RGs are coexpressed but are not independent of the experimental conditions the stability criteria based on inter- and intragroup variation fail. The linear error model developed, LEMming, overcomes the dependency of using RGs for parallel qPCR measurements, besides resolving biases of both technical and biological nature in qPCR. However, to distinguish systematic errors per treated group from a global treatment effect an additional measurement is needed. Quantification of total cDNA content per sample helps to identify systematic errors.",

	abstract = "A short tandem repeat (STR) typing method is developed for forensic identification of individual cells. In our strategy, monodisperse 1.5 nL agarose-in-oil droplets are produced with a high frequency using a microfluidic droplet generator. Statistically dilute single cells, along with primer-functionalized microbeads, are randomly compartmentalized in the droplets. Massively parallel single-cell droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is performed to transfer replicas of desired STR targets from the single-cell genomic DNA onto the coencapsulated microbeads. These DNA-conjugated beads are subsequently harvested and reamplified under statistically dilute conditions for conventional capillary electrophoresis (CE) STR fragment size analysis. The 9-plex STR profiles of single cells from both pure and mixed populations of GM09947 and GM09948 human lymphoid cells show that all alleles are correctly called and allelic drop-in/drop-out is not observed. The cell mixture study exhibits a good linear relationship between the observed and input cell ratios in the range of 1:1 to 10:1. Additionally, the STR profile of GM09947 cells could be deduced even in the presence of a high concentration of cell-free contaminating 9948 genomic DNA. Our method will be valuable for the STR analysis of samples containing mixtures of cells/DNA from multiple contributors and for low-concentration samples.",

	abstract = "Severe heart diseases such as myocarditis and cardiomyopathy are often characterized by progressive damages of contractile heart tissue which ultimately can lead to terminal heart failure. There is a need for relevant in vitro cultures of human cardiomyocytes to study pathogenic processes and to perform pharmacological testing of new heart drugs. By using the upcyte/EPCC (enhanced primary cell culture) approach for direct multiplication of organ-specific cells, we established proliferating human cardiomyocyte cultures derived from atrial appendages. For qualitative cardiac expression profiling we established a comprehensive set of multiplex PCR assays, selected from a panel of 32 genes, to rapidly screen changes at the transcriptional level in human ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes. Our multiplex PCR approach revealed some donor variability of native atrial heart tissue that need to be confirmed by further studies with more samples. Our initial studies further indicated that characteristic heart muscle cell markers such as MLC-2 a , MLC-2v , CHRM2 , ADRB1 , DES , EDRNB , C x40 and KCNA5 were down-regulated when isolated cardiomyocytes were taken into primary cell culture. Compared to native heart tissue, proliferating atrial cardiomyocytes lacked expression of those cardiac markers but still expressed MYCD , GATA-4 , Cx43 , SERCA2 , BNP , Tbx5 , EDNRA and ACTB . Surprisingly, atrium-derived cardiomyocytes started to express NFAc4 in passage three, and cardiomyocyte marker expressions of Cx43 and BNP were even increased over cultivation time. In conclusion, our novel multiplex PCR assays should be useful for expression profiling of native heart tissues from patients with different disease conditions and for characterization of in vitro cardiomyocyte cultures.",

In this work, proof of concept of a unique STR genotyping approach has been demonstrated using asymmetric PCR and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based hybridization analysis that combines fluorophore-labeled allele-specific probes and a DNA intercalating dye (dpFRET) in a melt match/mismatch analysis format. The system was successfully tested against both a simple (TPOX) and a complex (D3S1358) loci, demonstrated a preliminary detection limit of {\textless}10 genomic equivalents with no allelic dropout and mixture identification in both laboratory-generated and clinical samples. With additional development, this approach has the potential to contribute to advancing the use of STR loci for forensic applications and related fields.",

However, as with {qPCR}, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital {PCR} Experiments guidelines.

Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new technology.",

Although many research groups have independently dedicated their efforts to developing software tools for visualizing and analyzing these data, these tools are often not compatible with each other because of different data formats. Results: We developed an open unified format, Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML; current version: 0.2), which provides a basic framework for representing quantitative biological dynamics data for objects ranging from molecules to cells to organisms. BDML is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). Its advantages are machine and human readability and extensibility. BDML will improve the efficiency of development and evaluation of software tools for data visualization and analysis.

@article{mao_characterization_2007,
	abstract = "Background EvaGreen (EG) is a newly developed DNA-binding dye that has recently been used in quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), post-PCR DNA melt curve analysis and several other applications. However, very little is known about the physicochemical properties of the dye and their relevance to the applications, particularly to qPCR and post PCR DNA melt curve analysis. In this paper, we characterized EG along with a widely used qPCR dye, SYBR Green I (SG), for their DNA-binding properties and stability, and compared their performance in qPCR under a variety of conditions. Results This study systematically compared the DNA binding profiles of the two dyes under different conditions and had these findings: a) EG had a lower binding affinity for both double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) than SG; b) EG showed no apparent preference for either GC- or AT-rich sequence while SG had a slight preference for AT-rich sequence; c) both dyes showed substantially lower affinity toward ssDNA than toward dsDNA and even lower affinity toward shorter ssDNA fragments except that this trend was more pronounced for EG. Our results also demonstrated that EG was stable both under PCR condition and during routine storage and handling. In the comparative qPCR study, both EG and SG exhibited PCR interference when used at high dye concentration, as evident from delayed Ct and/or nonspecific product formation. The problem worsened when the chain extension time was shortened or when the amplicon size was relatively long ({\textgreater}500 bp). However, qPCR using EG tolerated a significantly higher dye concentration, thus permitting a more robust PCR signal as well as a sharper and stronger DNA melt peak. These differences in qPCR performance between the two dyes are believed to be attributable to their differences in DNA binding profiles. Conclusion These findings suggest that an ideal qPCR dye should possess several DNA-binding characteristics, including a {"}just right{"} affinity for dsDNA and low or no affinity for ssDNA and short DNA fragments. The favorable DNA-binding profile of EG, coupled with its good stability and instrument-compatibility, should make EG a promising dye for qPCR and related applications.",

	abstract = "BackgroundModel-based analysis of data from quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is potentially more powerful and versatile than traditional methods. Yet existing model-based approaches cannot properly deal with the higher sampling variances associated with low-abundant targets, nor do they provide a natural way to incorporate assumptions about the stability of control genes directly into the model-fitting process.ResultsIn our method, raw qPCR data are represented as molecule counts, and described using generalized linear mixed models under Poisson-lognormal error. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to sample from the joint posterior distribution over all model parameters, thereby estimating the effects of all experimental factors on the expression of every gene. The Poisson-based model allows for the correct specification of the mean-variance relationship of the PCR amplification process, and can also glean information from instances of no amplification (zero counts). Our method is very flexible with respect to control genes: any prior knowledge about the expected degree of their stability can be directly incorporated into the model. Yet the method provides sensible answers without such assumptions, or even in the complete absence of control genes. We also present a natural Bayesian analogue of the ``classic'' analysis, which uses standard data pre-processing steps (logarithmic transformation and multi-gene normalization) but estimates all gene expression changes jointly within a single model. The new methods are considerably more flexible and powerful than the standard delta-delta Ct analysis based on pairwise t-tests.ConclusionsOur methodology expands the applicability of the relative-quantification analysis protocol all the way to the lowest-abundance targets, and provides a novel opportunity to analyze qRT-PCR data without making any assumptions concerning target stability. These procedures have been implemented as the MCMC.qpcr package in R.",

This arises because the relational databases used in genomic research are difficult to adapt to rapidly evolving experimental designs, data formats and analytic algorithms. Here we describe an adaptive approach to managing experimental data based on semantically typed data hypercubes (SDCubes) that combine hierarchical data format 5 (HDF5) and extensible markup language (XML) file types. We demonstrate the application of SDCube-based storage using ImageRail, a software package for high-throughput microscopy. Experimental design and its day-to-day evolution, not rigid standards, determine how ImageRail data are organized in SDCubes. We applied ImageRail to collect and analyze drug dose-response landscapes in human cell lines at single-cell resolution.",

Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, VideoScan, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for PCR applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a HEp-2 cell assay.

They also form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, solid-phase PCR, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems (mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), quantification of nucleic acids, PCR in solution and the detection of amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous DNA hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and personalized medicine. Contains 211 references. Figure ",

Numerous real-time read-out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplification-based techniques, there are only few tools for pre-processing of amplification data. However, a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example, during the development of new instruments.Results: chipPCR is an R package for the pre-processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplification curves. The package takes advantage of R{\rq}s S4 object model and offers an extensible environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imputation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities of the software are enhanced by the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R, such as a 5-point stencil for derivative interpolation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification efficiency/quantification cycle calculation, and datasets from qPCR and qIA experiments are part of the package. Core functionalities are integrated in GUIs (web-based and standalone shiny applications), thus streamlining analysis and report generation.Availability and implementation: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chipPCR.

	abstract = "The analysis of quantitative {PCR} data usually does not take into account the fact that the increase in fluorescence depends on the monitoring chemistry, the input of ds-{DNA} or ss-{cDNA}, and the directionality of the targeting of probes or primers. The monitoring chemistries currently available can be categorized into six groups: (A) {DNA-binding} dyes; (B) hybridization probes; (C) hydrolysis probes; (D) {LUX} primers; (E) hairpin primers; and (F) the {QZyme} system. We have determined the kinetics of the increase in fluorescence for each of these groups with respect to the input of both ds-{DNA} and ss-{cDNA.} For the latter, we also evaluated {mRNA} and {cDNA} targeting probes or primers. This analysis revealed three situations. Hydrolysis probes and {LUX} primers, compared to {DNA-binding} dyes, do not require a correction of the observed quantification cycle. Hybridization probes and hairpin primers require a correction of −1 cycle (dubbed C-lag), while the {QZyme} system requires the C-lag correction and an efficiency-dependent C-shift correction. A {PCR} efficiency value can be derived from the relative increase in fluorescence in the exponential phase of the amplification curve for all monitoring chemistries. In case of hydrolysis probes, {LUX} primers and hairpin primers, however, this should be performed after cycle 12, and for the {QZyme} system after cycle 19, to keep the overestimation of the {PCR} efficiency below 0.5 \%. Figure The {qPCR} monitoring chemistries form six groups with distinct fluorescence kinetics. The displacement of the amplification curve depends on the chemistry, {DNA} input and probe-targeting. The observed shift in Cq values can be corrected and {PCR} efficiencies can be derived.",

Each of the three different MLC-2 genes (MLC-2f; fast twitch skeletal isoform, MLC-2v; cardiac ventricular and slow twitch skeletal isoform, MLC-2a; cardiac atrial isoform) has a distinct developmental expression pattern in mammals. Genetic loss-of-function studies in mice demonstrated an essential role for cardiac isoforms of MLC-2, MLC-2v and MLC-2a, in cardiac contractile function during early embryogenesis. In the adult heart, MLC-2v function is regulated by phosphorylation, which displays a specific 1`expression pattern (high in epicardium and low in endocardium) across the heart. These data along with new data from computational models, genetic mouse models, and human studies have revealed a direct role for MLC-2v phosphorylation in cross-bridge cycling kinetics, calcium-dependent cardiac muscle contraction, cardiac torsion, cardiac function and various cardiac diseases. This review focuses on the regulatory functions of MLC-2 in the embryonic and adult heart, with an emphasis on phosphorylation-driven actions of MLC-2v in adult cardiac muscle, which provide new insights into mechanisms regulating myosin cycling kinetics and human cardiac diseases.",

	abstract = "Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and the revival of deep CNN. CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, layered hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, with 85\% sensitivity at 3 false positive per patient, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.",

This assay employs a new dye, PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation reagent, which becomes intensely fluorescent upon binding nucleic acids. The brightness of this reagent is due to its high quantum yield (approximately 0.5, bound to ds calf thymus DNA) and large molar extinction coefficient (approximately 70,000 cm-1 M-1). The fluorescence enhancement of this dye upon binding dsDNA is {\textgreater} 1000-fold, with excitation and emission maxima near those of fluorescein. Unlike Hoechst 33258, PicoGreen reagent fluorescence intensity was the same upon binding to poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dG).poly(dC) homopolymers. The PicoGreen assay allowed the detection of 25 pg/ml dsDNA, surpassing the sensitivity achieved with Hoechst 33258 by 400-fold. The linear concentration range for DNA quantitation extended over four orders of magnitude-25 pg/ml to 1 microgram/ml-with a single dye concentration. Assay linearity was maintained even in the presence of salts, proteins, poly(ethylene glycol), urea, chloroform, ethanol, and agarose; some ionic detergents and heparin interfered. Linear DNAs yielded slightly brighter signals than supercoiled plasmids. Finally, the assay showed greater dsDNA:RNA selectivity than Hoechst 33258 in low ionic strength buffer and better dsDNA:single-stranded DNA selectivity in 1 M NaCl.",

	abstract = "PCR-based DNA typing of biological evidence is now widely used in forensic analyses due to the obvious advantages of enhanced sensitivity, the ability to distinguish discrete alleles and efficacy with degraded samples. A multiplex short tandem repeat (STR) system has been previously developed which successfully co-amplifies six STR loci HUMTH01, D21S11, D18S51, D8S1179, HUMVWF31/A and HUMFIBRA (FGA) in conjunction with the X-Y homologous gene Amelogenin. This is known as the second generation multiplex system (SGM). Detection of the PCR products is undertaken on ABD 373A or 377 automated sequencers using denaturing polyacrylamide gels coupled with fluorescent-based technology. We have evaluated this system for routine forensic use and demonstrated that the technique is robust and reproducible under conditions consistent with those encountered in a forensic environment. A total of 132 stains from simulated and actual casework were analysed, together with relevant control areas and reference samples. The success rate was high with 76\% of stains giving full profiles; we were also able to successfully detect and interpret mixtures. No mistyping was observed. A detailed examination of each of these profiles has assisted in the development of guidelines for casework interpretation. Although artefacts, stutter peaks and undenatured DNA were occasionally observed, these did not interfere with the accuracy of interpretation. In addition 38 samples, previously examined using the quadruplex system, were analysed with the SGM to enable a direct comparison to be made between the systems. The performance of the system with poor quality samples demonstrated its use as a rapid and powerful technique for individual identification.",

	abstract = "Forensic scientists are constantly searching for better, faster, and less expensive ways to increase the first-pass success rate of forensic sample analysis. Technological advances continue to increase the sensitivity of analysis methods to enable genotyping of samples containing minimal amounts of DNA, yet few tools are available that can simultaneously alert the analyst to both the presence of inhibition and level of degradation in samples prior to genotyping to allow analysts the opportunity to make appropriate modifications to their protocols and, consequently, to use less sample. Our laboratory developed a multiplex quantitative PCR assay that amplifies two human nuclear DNA target sequences of different length to assess DNA degradation and a third amplification target, a synthetic oligonucleotide internal PCR control (IPC), to allow for the assessment of PCR inhibition. We chose the two nuclear targets to provide quantity and fragment-length information relevant to the STR amplification targets commonly used for forensic genotyping. The long target (nuTH01, 170--190 bp) spans the TH01 STR locus and uses a FAM-labeled TaqMan{\textregistered} probe for detection. The short nuclear target (nuCSF, 67 bp) is directed at the upstream flanking region of the CSF1PO STR locus and is detected using a VIC-labeled TaqManMGB{\textregistered} probe. The IPC target sequence is detected using a NED-labeled TaqManMGB{\textregistered} probe. The assay was validated on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR system, which is optimized for NED detection. We report the results of a developmental validation in which the assay was rigorously tested, in accordance with the current SWGDAM guidelines, for precision, sensitivity, accuracy, reproducibility, species specificity, and stability.",

	abstract = "Recent advances in fluorescent dyes, methods, instruments and software for {DNA} melting analysis have created versatile new tools for variant scanning and genotyping. High resolution melting analysis ({HRM} or {HRMA}) is faster, simpler, and less expensive than alternative approaches requiring separations or labeled probes. With the addition of a saturating dye before {PCR} followed by rapid melting analysis of the {PCR} products, the sensitivity of heterozygote scanning approaches 100\%. Specificity can be increased by identifying common polymorphisms with small amplicon melting, unlabeled probes or snapback primers to decrease the sequencing burden. However, some homozygotes require mixing for identification. Furthermore, different heterozygotes may produce melting curves so similar to each other that, although they clearly vary from homozygous variants, they are not differentiated from each other. Nevertheless, the experimental return for minimal effort is great. This focus issue of Human Mutation includes a concise, timely review on high resolution melting, a comparison to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, integration with {qPCR} for copy number assessment, combined amplicon scanning and unlabeled probe genotyping from a single melting curve, and applications to the mitochondrial genome and to {BRCA}1.

We report that SYBR Green I is alkali labile and once degraded inhibits the PCR. In our optimized protocol, diluted aliquots of SYBR Green I remain stable for at least two weeks. We also evaluated different cDNA synthesis protocols for the quantification of multiple genes from the same cDNA preparation. The best result was obtained with cDNAs synthesized by OmniScript™ reverse transcriptase from 2.5 μg total RNA using oligo d(T)18 primers. The cDNA reactions could be diluted 1:25, allowing the quantification of up to 125 different medium expressed genes of Arabidopsis. Extension times ranged between 20 and 40 bp/s for accurate quantification of PCR products up to approximately 400 bp in the Rotor-Gene 2000 system. Using our optimized real-time PCR protocol, the reproducibility and amplification efficiency was high and comparable to a commercially available SYBR Green I kit. Furthermore, the sensitivity allowed us to quantify 10--20 copies of mRNA and dsDNA. Thus, the protocol eliminates the need for expensive pre-made kits.",

The video camera detects the accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in each PCR using the increase in the fluorescence of ethidium bromide (EtBr) that results from its binding duplex DNA. The kinetics of fluorescence accumulation during thermocycling are directly related to the starting number of DNA copies. The fewer cycles necessary to produce a detectable fluorescence, the greater the number of target sequences. Results obtained with this approach indicate that a kinetic approach to PCR analysis can quantitate DNA sensitively, selectively and over a large dynamic range. This approach also provides a means of determining the effect of different reaction conditions on the efficacy of the amplification and so can provide insight into fundamental PCR processes.",

	abstract = "Probability estimation for binary and multicategory outcome using logistic and multinomial logistic regression has a long-standing tradition in biostatistics. However, biases may occur if the model is misspecified. In contrast, outcome probabilities for individuals can be estimated consistently with machine learning approaches, including k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), bagged nearest neighbors (b-NN), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). Because machine learning methods are rarely used by applied biostatisticians, the primary goal of this paper is to explain the concept of probability estimation with these methods and to summarize recent theoretical findings. Probability estimation in k-NN, b-NN, and RF can be embedded into the class of nonparametric regression learning machines; therefore, we start with the construction of nonparametric regression estimates and review results on consistency and rates of convergence. In SVMs, outcome probabilities for individuals are estimated consistently by repeatedly solving classification problems. For SVMs we review classification problem and then dichotomous probability estimation. Next we extend the algorithms for estimating probabilities using k-NN, b-NN, and RF to multicategory outcomes and discuss approaches for the multicategory probability estimation problem using SVM. In simulation studies for dichotomous and multicategory dependent variables we demonstrate the general validity of the machine learning methods and compare it with logistic regression. However, each method fails in at least one simulation scenario. We conclude with a discussion of the failures and give recommendations for selecting and tuning the methods. Applications to real data and example code are provided in a companion article (doi:10.1002/bimj.201300077).",

	abstract = {Amplification curves from quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments typically exhibit a sigmoidal shape. They can roughly be divided into a ground or baseline phase, an exponential amplification phase, a linear phase and finally a plateau phase, where in the latter, the PCR product concentration no longer increases. Nevertheless, in some cases the plateau phase displays a negative trend, e.g. in hydrolysis probe assays. This cycle-to-cycle fluorescence decrease is commonly referred to in the literature as the hook effect. Other detection chemistries also exhibit this negative trend, however the underlying molecular mechanisms are different. In this study we present two approaches to automatically detect hook effect-like curvatures based on linear (hookreg) and nonlinear regression (hookregNL). As the hook effect is typical for qPCR data, both algorithms can be employed for the automated identification of regular structured qPCR curves. Therefore, our algorithms streamline quality control, but can also be used for assay optimization or machine learning.},
